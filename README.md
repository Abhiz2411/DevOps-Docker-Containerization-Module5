# Module 5: Containerization, Docker, and Docker Hub

Welcome to the **Module 5: Containerization, Docker, and Docker Hub** repository! üöÄ 

In this module, we'll explore the fascinating world of Docker, creating Docker images, managing containers, and utilizing Docker Hub for image distribution. 

## Tasks Covered:

1. **L1** - Create a Docker file and build the Docker container Application Image for the application built in the Jenkins Module, then push the image to DockerHub.
2. **L2** - Create the Container using the same Application Image and run the application in a Web Browser using container port mapping.
3. **L3** - Demonstrate Docker Compose using the Application Image and MySQL Image to start and stop all container services.

## Contents of the Repository:

- Basic Docker commands with explanations
- How to write a Dockerfile
