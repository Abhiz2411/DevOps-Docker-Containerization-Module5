# Docker Compose File Explained

## What is a Docker Compose File?
- A Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) is a YAML configuration used to define and manage multiple Docker 
	containers. 
- It simplifies running multi-container applications with just one command by describing how containers should 
	behave, connect, and share resources.
- Docker Compose helps with orchestration, allowing services to be spun up and connected with ease.

## Structure of a Docker Compose File

Below is a breakdown of key components of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

1. **version**:
   - Specifies the Compose file format version. Latest is usually `3.x`.
   - Example: `version: "3.9"`

2. **services**:
   - Defines individual containers (services) to be deployed.
   - Each service runs one image in a container with specific configurations (e.g., ports, environment variables).

3. **networks**:
   - Configures custom Docker networks for container communication.
   - Useful for controlling how services are exposed to each other.

4. **volumes** (Optional):
   - Persistent storage for services, ensuring data persists even if the container stops.

## Example Docker Compose File with Networking

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      - my-network

  database:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
    networks:
      - my-network

networks:
  my-network:
    driver: bridge
```

---

## Explanation of the Example

1. **version**:
   - Specifies the Compose version being used (`3.9` in this case).

2. **services**:
   - Defines two services:
     - `web`: Runs an Nginx server and exposes it on port 8080 of the host.
     - `database`: Runs MySQL with a root password set via environment variables.

3. **ports**:
   - Maps port `80` of the `web` container to port `8080` on the host machine.

4. **environment**:
   - Sets the environment variables for the `database` service, configuring MySQL credentials.

5. **networks**:
   - Creates a network called `my-network` using the `bridge` driver (Dockerâ€™s default networking driver). 
   - Both services are connected to this network, allowing them to communicate internally.

---

## Usage

1. Save the YAML content in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the services.
3. Use `docker-compose down` to stop and remove the containers and network.

---

This file defines:
- **Two services** (Nginx and MySQL) connected over a **custom bridge network**.
- Nginx can serve requests, and MySQL acts as a backend, both accessible to each other through the same network.
